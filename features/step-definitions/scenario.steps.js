// Most scenario steps are defined in simulation.steps.js
// This file is kept minimal to avoid duplicate step definitions

// ==========================================
// What-If Scenario Steps (additional)
// ==========================================

// Note: Many scenario steps are duplicated in simulation.steps.js.
// This file contains only additional steps not covered there.
// If tests fail due to duplicate step definitions, they can be removed from here.

// What-If Scenario Assertions (additional)
// ==========================================

// Most assertions are also in simulation.steps.js
