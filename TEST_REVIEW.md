### Analysis of Test Files

Here's a breakdown of each test file and an assessment of its coupling to implementation details.

#### `tests/unit/stores/vsmStore.test.js`

*   **Purpose:** Tests the state management for the Value Stream Map, which includes actions like adding/removing steps and connections. It uses `zustand` for state management.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   The tests directly call actions on the store (`useVsmStore.getState().addStep(...)`) and then assert on the state (`expect(useVsmStore.getState().steps).toHaveLength(1)`).
    *   This is a common pattern for testing state management stores. The tests are coupled to the *state shape* and the *actions* provided by the store.
*   **Coupling Concern:** **Medium.**
    *   **Why:** These tests are tightly coupled to the internal state structure of the `vsmStore`. If you were to refactor the store's state (e.g., rename `steps` to `processSteps`, or change how connections are stored), these tests would break, even if the component-facing behavior remains identical.
    *   **Example:** `expect(useVsmStore.getState().connections).toHaveLength(1)` and `expect(useVsmStore.getState().selectedConnectionId).toBe(connId)`. These check the raw state values.
    *   **Alternative:** A less coupled approach would be to test the store through the public interface of the components that use it. However, for complex state logic, unit testing the store directly is often a pragmatic choice. The key is to be aware that a store refactor will likely require a test refactor.

#### `tests/unit/stores/simulationStore.test.js`

*   **Purpose:** Tests the state management for the simulation controls and results, also using `zustand`.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   Similar to `vsmStore.test.js`, this file directly manipulates and asserts on the store's state. It calls actions like `setRunning(true)` and then checks `expect(useSimulationStore.getState().isRunning).toBe(true)`.
    *   It also uses `useSimulationStore.setState()` in the `beforeEach` and in some tests to set up specific scenarios. This is a direct manipulation of the store's internal state.
*   **Coupling Concern:** **Medium.**
    *   **Why:** The reasoning is the same as for `vsmStore.test.js`. The tests are verifying the implementation of the store's reducers and actions by checking the resulting state. A change in the state's structure would break these tests.
    *   **Example:** The `reset` test sets a series of state properties and then asserts that they have been reset to their initial values, except for a few that are intentionally preserved. This is a white-box test that knows exactly what the `reset` action should do internally.

#### `tests/unit/simulation/simulationEngine.test.js`

*   **Purpose:** Tests the core logic of the simulation engine, which is a set of pure functions.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   This file imports and tests individual functions like `initSimulation`, `processTick`, `generateWorkItems`, etc.
    *   The tests provide a specific input (e.g., a set of steps and connections) and assert that the function returns the expected output.
    *   For example, `processTick` is given a state object and returns a new state object, and the tests check the properties of the new state.
*   **Coupling Concern:** **Low.**
    *   **Why:** These tests are classic examples of testing pure functions. They are coupled to the *function signature* (the inputs and outputs), but not to the internal implementation of *how* the result is calculated. For example, the test for `processTick` doesn't care *how* progress is advanced, only that it *is* advanced. If the internal calculation was refactored for performance but the result remained the same, the tests would still pass. This is a desirable characteristic.
    *   **Example:** `const newState = processTick(state, mockSteps, mockConnections); expect(newState.workItems[0].progress).toBeGreaterThan(0);`. This checks the public contract of the function: given a state, the returned state should have updated progress.

#### `tests/unit/calculations/metrics.test.js`

*   **Purpose:** Tests a collection of pure functions that calculate various metrics based on the Value Stream Map data.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   This is very similar to `simulationEngine.test.js`. It imports functions like `calculateTotalLeadTime` and `calculateFlowEfficiency` and tests them with different inputs.
    *   The tests are concerned with inputs and outputs.
*   **Coupling Concern:** **Low.**
    *   **Why:** These are well-written unit tests for pure functions. They test the logic, not the implementation. For example, `calculateFlowEfficiency` is tested to return the correct value, status, and display string for a given set of steps. The internal implementation of that calculation could change, but as long as the outputs are correct for the inputs, the tests will pass.
    *   **Example:** `const result = calculateFlowEfficiency(steps); expect(result.value).toBe(0.25);`. This is a perfect example of testing the output against a known input, without any knowledge of the internal workings of the function.

### Summary Report

Based on the review, here is a summary of the findings regarding tests coupled to implementation:

**High Coupling (Requires Attention):**

*   No tests were found to have what I would classify as "high" coupling in a way that is immediately problematic. However, the store tests are worth noting.

**Medium Coupling (Pragmatic but Brittle):**

*   **`tests/unit/stores/vsmStore.test.js`**: These tests are coupled to the exact shape of the `vsmStore` state. Refactoring the store's internal structure will likely break these tests, even if the application's functionality remains unchanged from a user's perspective.
*   **`tests/unit/stores/simulationStore.test.js`**: Similar to the `vsmStore` tests, these are coupled to the shape of the `simulationStore` state. They test the implementation of the store's actions by directly inspecting the resulting state.

**Low Coupling (Good):**

*   **`tests/unit/simulation/simulationEngine.test.js`**: These tests focus on the inputs and outputs of pure functions, making them resilient to refactoring of the internal implementation.
*   **`tests/unit/calculations/metrics.test.js`**: These are excellent examples of behavior-driven tests for pure functions. They verify the correctness of the calculations without being tied to the specific implementation.

### Recommendations

The primary area for potential improvement is in the testing of the `zustand` stores. While direct state testing is a valid and common approach, it's important to recognize that it creates a maintenance cost. When the store's implementation is changed, these tests will likely need to be updated.

No immediate action is required, as these tests are still valuable for verifying the store's logic. However, for future tests, or if the stores become more complex, consider the following:

1.  **Focus on Behavior:** When possible, try to test the *behavior* that the store enables, rather than the state itself. For example, instead of checking `state.isRunnning`, you might test that a "Run" button becomes disabled. This would require more of an integration test setup (e.g., using React Testing Library).
2.  **Use Selectors:** If the store has complex selectors that derive data from the state, test the selectors directly. This can help isolate the test from the raw state structure.

The tests for the simulation engine and metrics calculations are well-structured and serve as a good model for testing business logic within the application. They are not tightly coupled to implementation details and should be robust to refactoring.
