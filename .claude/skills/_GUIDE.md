## 🚫 When NOT to Use Skills

Skills are workflows for common tasks. Don't use skills for:

- **Bug fixes** - Fix directly using TDD
- **Refactoring** - Refactor while keeping tests green
- **Documentation updates** - Edit docs directly
- **Configuration changes** - Update config files directly
- **Small tweaks** - Make change, run quality gates, commit

---

## 💡 Tips

### Before Starting Any Skill

1. Understand the requirement
2. Check if similar code exists
3. Read relevant rules files
4. Prepare test data (if needed)

### During Skill Execution

1. Follow the skill workflow in order
2. Don't skip steps (especially tests!)
3. Run quality gates frequently
4. Ask for clarification if stuck

### After Completing Skill

1. Run full quality gates
2. Manually test the feature
3. Update documentation
4. Commit with good message
